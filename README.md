**Hi I'm Nick!** <br/>
I generally make websites and contribute to UI projects.<br/>
Unfortunately, most of my work is held privately, as its no fun to have company designs stolen, but I did make my personal portfolio website public!<br/>
Go visit that portfolio website at https://nickdimegl.io!<br/>
You can get a good idea of what I do there!<br/>
